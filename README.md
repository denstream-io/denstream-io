# About me 👋

## As an Electrical/Electronic Engineering Student @ FUTMX

As a child, I was utterly astonished by the seemingly magical ability to control every aspect of a TV 
without even being close to it! As I matured, my insatiable curiosity led me on a relentless pursuit 
of knowledge, delving deep into the inner workings of electronic gadgets. With each research endeavor, 
I became increasingly aware of the immense practicality and profound importance of electronic 
engineering.

My fascination grew exponentially as I sought to comprehend the underlying principles that 
enable these gadgets to perform their remarkable feats. It dawned on me that, much like atoms 
are the fundamental building blocks of matter and cells are the building blocks of life, transistors 
serve as the bedrock upon which electronic devices thrive. The dependency of virtually all electronic
gadgets on these minuscule components left me in awe.

Transistors, both simple and complex, stand as miniature electronic marvels compared to their
antiquated vacuum tube counterparts. Astoundingly, they possess the extraordinary ability to 
function as amplifiers or switches, all while being fabricated from sand! Casting my gaze back 
to the 1940s, the ENIAC computer, with its sprawling dimensions equaling three to four 
containers, housed thousands of vacuum tubes. Yet, it paled in comparison to the sheer 
power packed within the confines of modern smartphones. The history of transistors reads
like a captivating tale of magic, where ingenuity reigned supreme. Jack Kilby and Robert Noyce, 
two pioneering minds, independently bestowed upon the world the gift of integrated circuits 
(microcontrollers), squeezing boundless power into diminishing spaces through their 
creative brilliance.

Armed with this wealth of knowledge, my passion for scientific and technical research 
burgeoned, igniting an insatiable desire to explore further. The realms of mathematics 
and physics became my playground at the A-level, with a special affinity for the enigmatic 
physics of semiconductors. The ability to fathom nature at the infinitesimal scale ushered 
in a revolution in the electronics industry, forever altering its landscape through the wonders 
of miniaturization. Mathematics bestowed upon me the prowess to tackle problems with 
unyielding rigor and precision, while physics afforded me the means to perceive our universe 
both theoretically and practically.

Equipped with these invaluable skills, I found joy in aiding my peers in unraveling perplexing 
scientific quandaries, and the privilege of imparting knowledge to a select group of students. 
The prospect of obtaining a degree from the esteemed Federal University of Technology, Minna, fills 
me with boundless excitement, for it promises not only personal and professional growth but 
also a pivotal role in the advancement of my beloved country.

Though my educational journey was beset with sporadic setbacks due to financial constraints, 
my determination remained resolute. External hindrances shall not extinguish the flames of 
my abilities and spirit. Adapting to new environments, forging lasting friendships, and engaging 
in fruitful group collaborations come effortlessly to me. I yearn to persist on my research odyssey, 
amassing unwavering expertise and honing my skills to perfection.

# Why Study Computer Programming too

One of the defining aspects of my character is an unwavering passion for continuous learning 
and staying up-to-date with the latest advancements in the dynamic field of software development. 
I find immense joy in taking on challenging problems and actively seeking out projects that stretch 
the boundaries of my current knowledge. This innate drive enables me to adapt quickly to new 
programming languages, embrace industry best practices, and thrive in diverse development experiences.

As a student pursuing a major in Electronic Engineering at the esteemed Federal University of Technology, 
Minna(Nigeria), I have cultivated a versatile skill set that encompasses programming languages such as C, and 
JavaScript, as well as non-programming languages like HTML and CSS. This versatility empowers me to 
contribute effectively within a team environment or take the lead in collaborative projects.

Continual personal growth holds the utmost importance for me, and I am genuinely thrilled to delve 
deeper into the intricacies of the software developer position while gaining a comprehensive understanding 
of the MLH community and its exceptional team. I am fully committed to honing my programming skills 
and delivering exceptional solutions that surpass the expectations of both employers and clients.

I firmly believe in the value of consistency and lifelong learning. I consider myself an eternal student, 
always seeking opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills. When faced with a problem, I approach 
it from various angles to gain a comprehensive understanding of the underlying concepts. If I encounter 
any uncertainties, I turn to documentation and online discussion forums for guidance. Asking questions 
has been an integral part of my personal and professional growth.

To further enhance my programming proficiency, I have successfully completed several notable courses, 
including CS50X, CS50P, CS50T, and MIT 6.001x, all with a focus on Python. Currently, I am actively 
engaged in CS50AI and CS50Web courses, further broadening my understanding of artificial intelligence 
and web development.
